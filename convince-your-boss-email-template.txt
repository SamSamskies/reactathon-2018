SUBJECT: Request to attend a React.js Conference in San Francisco

Dear [your manager's name],

I’d like your permission to attend a special edition of Reactathon (reactathon.com), the largest React Conference on the West Coast, from September 7 - 8 in San Francisco. The conference features some of the biggest names in the React community from companies including Microsoft, Netflix, Flexport, NPM, and GitHub. It is held on a Friday evening + Saturday, so no work will be missed. Attending this conference will be beneficial for both my personal growth and our company’s front-end knowledge in the following areas:

* Increase knowledge of performance-based architecture
* Learn the fundamentals of type systems to improve developer confidence to ship fewer bugs
* A/B testing at scale from Netflix
* Improving accessibility with A11Y
* Optimizing performance with code splitting
* Improving the updates of single fields in an object with functional lenses
* Data visualizations with React + D3
* Gain valuable hands-on experience in day-long technical bootcamps or three-hour workshops, which I can bring back to my team.

Here’s an estimated breakdown of costs:

Registration fee................................................	$349
Total............................................................	$349

After the conference, I’ll circulate a report that will include a summary of what I learned and a set of recommendations to increase our team’s productivity and improve our front-end infrastructure.

Thank you for considering my request to attend this event.

Looking forward to your reply,

[your name]
