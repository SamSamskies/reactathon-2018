    "talkDescription": "Over the last two years, React Native has helped many developers quickly build high quality, mobile applications targeting multiple platforms. The community and the ecosystem of plugins and tooling around the technology has also helped many developers bring in all the functionality previously available only to native developers. In this talk, we will look at the current state of React Native and discuss the common pain points developers have. The talk will also summarize some of the discussions in the React Native core team and new ideas being tried out. We will cover the rationale behind efforts like moving documentation to a separate repo, reducing the surface area of the API, etc. Based on the work done by the contributors, we will map out what it may mean for React Native to hit a symbolic 1.0 release.",

Sometimes you want more control, or your use case is so simple you can avoid bringing in an unneeded dependency, or maybe you just want to strip away the magic for a moment and learn how the browser's drawing APIs really work.  We'll go over some examples of building charts with basic HTML, SVG and Canvas.",

    "talkDescription": "GraphQL is quickly becoming mainstream as one of the best ways to get data into your React application. When we see people modernize their app architecture and move to React, they often want to migrate their API to GraphQL as part of the same effort. But while React is super easy to adopt in a small part of your app at a time, GraphQL can seem like a much larger investment. In this talk, we’ll go over the fastest and most effective ways for React developers to incrementally migrate their existing APIs and backends to GraphQL, then talk about opportunities for improvement in the space. If you’re using React and are interested in GraphQL, but are looking for an extra push to get it up and running at your company, this is the talk for you!",
